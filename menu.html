            <h2>FairyTail Guild</h2>
            <p>Fairy Tail (妖精の尻尾フェアリーテイル Fearī Teiru) is the strongest guild in the Kingdom of Fiore. It was originally disbanded in the aftermath of the Guild War against Tartaros, however it was reestablished one year later by many of its more prominent members. The name of "Fairy Tail" represents a sense of adventure for one to be able to discover more about mysteries and fate. Fairy Tail's original location was situated in the Kingdom of Fiore, on the southern coast of the country in Magnolia Town where it was the only guild (until the arrival of Twilight Ogre). It was located in the south of the town not far from the coast, and the guild was situated about 4-5 kilometers up the Magnolia central path. When the core members of Fairy Tail disappeared for 7 years, the remaining members could no longer afford to keep Fairy Tail's first building so it went into foreclosure.  After they left it, they moved into a small tavern, that lies on top of a small hill, and made it their base of operations. Though upon arriving back in Magnolia town after their victory at the Grand Magic Games, the guild's first building has since been rebuilt in the center of the city by the people of Magnolia town as a reward for their victory in the Grand Magic Games.</p>

                    <p>Wendy Marvell (ウェンディ・マーベル Wendi Māberu) is a young female Sky Dragon Slayer. She was one of the orphans chosen to be a Dragon Slayer four hundred years prior to X777, serving as her foster mother's vessel to travel to X777 through the Eclipse Gate as a part of the plan to exterminate Acnologia. Formerly belonging to the Cait Shelter Guild, she officially joins the Fairy Tail Guild after the events surrounding Nirvana unfold. Following the disbandment of Fairy Tail, Wendy, along with Carla, joined Lamia Scale. Subsequent to the conclusion of the war between Orochi's Fin and Lamia Scale, Wendy leaves Lamia Scale and helps Natsu resurrect Fairy Tail.</p>

The judgement of whether someone is friend or foe comes from the user's heart, and they cannot lie to this Magic. Even if the user directly aims it at someone, the target will not be harmed if the caster does not truly see them as an enemy. It is considered one of the most powerful Magics and is one of the rare legendary spells.</p>

The Magic protects the Guild from any evil and is an absolute defense Magic, powerful enough to defend against even time. The sphere itself acts as a stasis chamber, a place in which time stops, thus everyone within the sphere is stuck in a frozen state in which they don't age. It's powerful enough to protect Tenrou Island and everyone on it from Acnologia's Dragon's Roar.</p>

This secret is only known by Fairy Tail's Guild Master and is passed on to the new Master successively. Precht showed it to Makarov when he became Master. Years later, Makarov showed it to Gildarts Clive when he told him that he wanted him to be next Master of Fairy Tail. According to Ivan Dreyar, Fairy Heart is Fairy Tail's darkness, while according to Mavis Vermillion, it is Fairy Tail's light. Later, it is revealed that Fairy Heart is in fact the body of Mavis Vermillion encased in a Lacrima. Makarov refers to it as the "ultimate weapon" of Fairy Tail.</p>
